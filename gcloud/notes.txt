check-errors:

Here, I run the code repeatedly on fragments of text ranging in length
from 50 to 10,000 words, tabulating the reported odds along with the
fraction of successful determinations.  If the reported odds are
correct, then this sucessful fraction should be propto [1 + exp(odds)]^(-1)

Run the test three times:
set1 has a training set of ~25,000 words and a test set of ~40,000 words
set2 has a training set of ~40,000 words and a test set of ~25,000 words

finally, I use the full training set of non-disputed Federalist
papers, and check it against the full corpus of Federalist papers
(excluding #55, which seems contaminated, and assuming that Madison
wrote all of the disputed ones, which seems pretty darn clear.)

Unfortunately, there's not a lot of data to work with!
